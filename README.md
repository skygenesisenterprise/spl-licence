# Sky Genesis Enterprise Public License v1.0 (SPL-1.0)

## Overview

The Sky Genesis Enterprise Public License v1.0 (SPL-1.0) is an open source license designed to provide file-level copyleft protection for software projects. It allows for broad use, modification, and redistribution of covered files, while ensuring that modifications to those files remain under the same license.

## Key Features

- **File-Level Copyleft:** Modified files must remain under SPL-1.0, but larger works can combine covered files with proprietary code if clearly separated.
- **Patent Grant:** Contributors grant a patent license for their contributions.
- **Redistribution:** You may distribute the work and derivatives, provided you include the license and retain notices.
- **No Warranty:** The work is provided "AS IS", without warranties or conditions of any kind.
